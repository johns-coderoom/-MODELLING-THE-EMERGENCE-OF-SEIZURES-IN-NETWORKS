 MODELLING THE EMERGENCE OF SEIZURES IN NETWORKS  
This session aims to introduce  a phenomenological model of seizure  
transitions, the theta model [1]. The theta model is a phase oscillator model, i.e. it  
describes the dynamics of an oscillator. A single oscillator may be used to represent  
the brain activity at one brain region. A network of oscillators may then represent the  
dynamics of a brain network. In this model, large oscillations represent seizure  
activity, whereas low amplitude fluctuations correspond to a ‘normal’ brain activity.  
This worksheet is split into three parts:   
(i) Simulate a deterministic phase oscillator   
(2) Simulate a stochastic phase oscillator  
(3) Simulate a network of interacting phase oscillators
